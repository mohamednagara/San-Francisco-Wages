## Conclusion
In conclusion, the comprehensive analysis of San Francisco city employees' salaries provides valuable insights into the dynamics of compensation over the study period from 2013 to 2022. The salary trends exhibit a notable positive trajectory, witnessing a significant increase from an approximate $70,000 to $105,000. This substantial growth reflects the evolving economic landscape and employment conditions in the city.

The examination of the salary distribution reveals an interesting pattern. The data follows a left-skewed distribution, indicating that the majority of salaries are concentrated on the lower end, gradually decreasing as we move away from the central peak. This skewed nature, also known as a "left-skewed distribution" or "negative skew," highlights the prevalence of salaries around $60,000 per year, underscoring the central tendency of compensation in the city. However, the presence of extreme values, such as the highest salary reaching approximately $380,000 annually, showcases the diversity and range within the salary structure.

Analyzing the average salary evolution further emphasizes the dynamic nature of compensation in San Francisco. Over the study period, there was a noteworthy increase of 36.05%, indicating a positive trajectory in the overall remuneration landscape. Despite encountering two years of negative growth in 2014 and 2015, the subsequent exponential growth of 40 percentage points between 2014 and 2022 underscores the resilience and upward trend in salaries.

Turning attention to benefits, their evolution follows a similar positive trajectory, reaching an impressive +38%. Despite facing two years of negative growth from 2015 to 2016, the subsequent exponential growth showcases the significance and overall positive trend in employee benefits.

Lastly, exploring salary variations based on job categories sheds light on the disparities within the workforce. The highest-paying job families, particularly in medical and dental fields, command earnings exceeding $175,000 per year. Management, administrative, and DPW/PUC job families also exhibit substantial compensation. In contrast, the lowest-paying job family, public service aide, sees salaries just over $25,000 annually. This observation highlights the existing wage gaps and raises questions about the adequacy of compensation, especially considering the high cost of living and housing in San Francisco.

In essence, this analysis serves as a valuable resource for policymakers, employers, and employees alike, offering a nuanced understanding of salary dynamics, distribution patterns, and disparities within San Francisco's municipal workforce. The findings can inform strategic decision-making, policy formulation, and discussions around equitable compensation practices in the city.
